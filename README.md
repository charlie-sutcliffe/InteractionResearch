# VR Interaction Research Project

## Project Overview

In this project, we explored various methods for implementing weapon handling and firing interactions within a VR environment. By developing and testing different interaction styles, we aimed to understand how each version influences user experience and usability. We simulated interactions for the following weapons: a bow and an arrow, a boomerang, and projectiles. Each interaction was implemented using multiple techniques to assess their impact on engagement and realism.

## Interaction Types and Implementations

1. **Drawing a Bow and Shooting an Arrow**

   - Users will have the experience of pulling back a virtual bowstring and aiming an arrow, with distinct versions implemented using different combinations of haptic and sonic feedback 

2. **Ball Throwing and Shooting**
   - Users will have a "player shoot" ability similar to what we had in the Time and Space project. They will also be able to pick up and throw balls of various sizes and weights, with larger balls being heavier. 

3. **Throwing and catching a Boomerang**

   - Users will be able to throw and catch a virtual boomerang through button presses and motion tracked aiming

## Interaction Variants

Each weapon interaction was implemented in the following five distinct ways to gain insights into how each method influences the user experience:

1. **Button Presses**

   - This method relies on basic button inputs on the VR controller to handle and fire the weapons.

2. **Direct Object Manipulation**

   - This approach will allow users to interact directly with the weapon models in VR. They will grip, pull, and release parts of the weapon using natural hand interactions to trigger firing actions.

3. **Motion Controller Movements**

   - Leveraging the motion sensors in VR controllers, this method will interpret dynamic controller movements (such as pulling back a bowstring) to handle and fire the weapons.

4. **Combined Input Methods**
   - A hybrid approach that integrates multiple input methods (e.g., motion controller movements with hand gestures) to allow for a more nuanced and possibly more immersive experience.
5. **Audio and Haptic Feedback**
   - This method will provide synchronized audio and haptic feedback to enhance the user experience and realism of weapon interactions.

## Research

Our research aimed to understand how different interaction methods affect user experience and usability in VR environments.

### General Research Questions:

1. How do different interaction methods affect user engagement and realism in VR weapon handling and firing interactions?
2. Which interaction methods are most intuitive and user-friendly for each weapon type?
3. How do the various interaction methods impact the overall user experience in terms of immersion and enjoyment?We found that the choice of interaction method significantly influences user engagement, realism, and ease of use. Here are some key insights from our research:

### Preliminary Research Questions

1. **Are you familiar with traditional button actuated weapons?**

   - This question aims to gauge participants' familiarity with traditional video game weapons that are activated using button inputs. This will help us understand the baseline for our study.
     -Participant 1: Yes
     -Participant 2: Yes
     -Participant 3: Yes
     -Participant 4: Yes
     -Participant 5: Yes

2. **Have you used motion actuated weapons in VR before?**

   - This question seeks to determine if participants have experience with motion-controlled weapons in VR environments. This will help us understand their prior exposure to similar interactions.
     -Participant 1: Yes
     -Participant 2: Yes
     -Participant 3: Yes
     -Participant 4: Yes
     -Participant 5: No

   -**If yes to Q2:**
   -What was the weapons previously used with motion controls in VR? Why did you like (or not) it?

   -Participant 1: Yes, bow and arrow in VR game. Liked the realism and immersion.
   -Participant 2: Yes, sword in VR game. Liked the challenge and the sense of control.
   -Participant 3: Yes, gun in VR game. Liked the accuracy and the feeling of power.
   -Participant 4: Yes, unreal engine game that could catch bullets and throw it back at enemies. Liked the challenge and the sense of control.

3. **Have you experienced synchronized audio and haptic feedback devices in VR?**

- This question aims to understand participants' familiarity with devices that provide synchronized audio and haptic feedback in VR environments. This will help us gauge their experience with immersive technologies.
  -Participant 1: Yes
  -Participant 2: No
  -Participant 3: Yes
  -Participant 4: Yes
  -Participant 5: No, but has in traditional video games.

## Follow-up Questions:

1. **Which style of weapons handling worked best for you?**

   -Participant 1: Boomerang felt the best.
   -Participant 2: Bow and arrow.
   -Participant 3: In comparison, boomerang point and shoot felt weird. Bow and arrow felt the best.
   -Participant 4: Bow with haptic and audio feedback.
   -Participant 5: Bow with audio and haptic feedback, more immersive.

2. **What did you like most about the weapons handling?**

   -Participant 1: The realism of the boomerang.
   -Participant 2: The accuracy of the bow and arrow.
   -Participant 3: The haptic feedback on the bowstring.
   -Participant 4: The haptic feedback on the bowstring.
   -Participant 5: The immersive experience with audio and haptic feedback.

3. **Which interaction methods are most intuitive and user-friendly for each weapon type?**

   -Participant 1: All felt intuitive. Wanted more range of motion for the bowstring.
   -Participant 2: Throwing balls felt less intuitive, especially without mass haptic.
   -Participant 3: Bow with sound for bowstring. Wishes controller did not have interactions for both shooting and throwing balls; heavy balls felt very hard to throw.
   -Participant 4: Boomerang with point and shoot felt not intuitive because boomerangs are throwing objects IRL. Point and shoot felt intuitive for projectiles.
   -Participant 5: Bow movements felt very intuitive.

4. **Which interactions felt the more useful for weapons handling in other VR applications?**

   -Participant 1: Boomerang felt the most useful. Would like more control of the throwing motion.
   -Participant 2: Bow; haptic feedback made it feel the most realistic of all the interactions
   -Participant 3: Grab and throw felt applicable. But also pull, holding and releasing at the right time feels amazing
   -Participant 4: Point and shoot applies to many objects and actions. But bow and arrow feels the best to use in VR.
   -Participant 5: Exclusively throwing objects.
